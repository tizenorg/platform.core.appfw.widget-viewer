 * \section CAPI_LIVEBOX_VIEWER_MODULE_OVERVIEW Overview
 * Tizen(SLP) homescreen S/W framework is supporing the live box. (aka widget which is similiar with the android widget)
 *

 *
 * \subsection WhatIsTheLivebox 1. What is the Livebox
 * The live box is the widget of the TIZEN.
 *
 * It works as a small application displayed on other applications' (such as homescreen, lockscreen, etc ...) view.
 * Each live box can have (not a mandatory option) a PD (progressive disclosure) in which more detailed information can be found.
 * The content of PD can be exposed when a certain gesture (e.g., flick-down) has been applied to the live box.
 * If you are interested in developing a livebox, there are things you should know prior to making any source code for the box.
 * To make your live box added to any live box viewer application (e.g., live panel in our case), then you need to create and prepare    
 * controller(SO file), layout script (EDJE for a PD if necessary), configuration files.
 *
 * A livebox is managed by data provider, since each SO file of a livebox is loaded on and controlled by data provider using predefined ABI.
 * A viewer will receive any livebox's content in forms of "image file", "buffer" or "text" and display the content in various formats on its window.
 * A livebox developer needs to make sure that your live box generates desirable content in-time on a explicit update-request or periodic update.
 *
 * After a data provider loads a livebox's SO file, it then assigns a specific "file name" for the livebox via an argument of a livebox function.
 * Since then the livebox just generates content using then given file name.
 * Passing an image file (whose name is the previously given name) is the basic method for providing contents to the viewer.
 * But if you want play animation or handles user event in real-time, you can use the buffer type.
 *
 * And you should prepare the content of the Progressive Disclosure.
 * The Progressive Dislcosure is only updated by the "buffer" type. so you should prepare the layout script for it.
 * If you didn't install any script file for progressive disclosure, the viewer will ignore the "flick down" event from your livebox.
 *
 * \subsubsection Livebox 1.1 Livebox
 * Live box is a default content of your widget. It always displays on the screen and updated periodically.
 * It looks like below captured images.

 *
 * \subsubsection ProgressiveDisclosure 1.2 Progressive Disclosure
 * \image html PD.png Progressive Disclosure
 * Progressive disclosure will be displayed when a user flicks down a livebox. (basically it depends on the implementation of the view applications)
 * To supports this, a developer should prepare the layout script (EDJE only for the moment) of the livebox's PD. (or you can use the buffer directly)
 * Data provider supports EDJE script but the developer can use various scripts if (which is BIG IF) their interpreters can be implemented based on evas & ecore.
 *
 * When a layout script has been installed, data provider can load and rendering the given layout on the buffer.
 * The content on the buffer can be shared between applications that need to display the content on their window.
 * Description data file is necessary to place proper content components in rendered layout.
 * Check this page Description Data. 
 *
 * \subsubsection ClusterCategory 1.3 What is the "cluster" and "category"
 * The cluster and the sub-cluster is just like the grouping concept.
 * It is used for creating/destorying your livebox instance when the data provider receives any context event from the context engine.
 * You will only get "user,created" cluster and "default" category(sub cluster) info.
 *
 * \subsection LiveboxContent 2. How the livebox can draw contents for viewer?
 * There are several ways to update the content of a livebox.
 *
 * \li Image file based content updating
 * \li Description file based content updating (with the layout script file)
 * \li Buffer based content updating
 *
 * Each method has specific benefit for implementing the livebox.
 *
 * \subsubsection ImageFormat 2.1 Via image file
 * This is the basic method for providing content of a livebox to the viewer application.
 * But this can be used only for the livebox. (Unavailable for the progressive disclosure).
 * When your livebox is created, the provider will assign an unique ID for your livebox(it would be a filename).
 * You should keep that ID until your livebox is running. The ID will be passed to you via livebox_create function.
 * \image html image_format.png
 *
 * When you need to update the output of your livebox, you should generate the image file using given ID(filename).
 * Then the data provider will recognize the event of updated output of a livebox and it will send that event to the viewer to reload it on the screen.
 *
 * \subsubsection ScriptFormat 2.2 Via layout script
 * \image html script_format.png
 * This method is supported for static layout & various contents (text & image)
 * When you develop your livebox, first design the layout of box content using script (edje is default)
 * Then the provider will load it to the content buffer and start rendering.
 * After the sciprt is loaded, you can fill it using description data format.
 * liblivebox defines description data handling functions.
 *
 * \subsubsection TextFormat 2.3 Via text data
 * \image html text_format.png
 * This is the simplified method to update the content of livebox.
 * So your box only need to update the text data using description data format.
 * Then the viewer will parse it to fill its screen.
 * So there is no buffer area, just viewer decide how handles it.
 *
 * \subsubsection BufferFormat 2.4 Via buffer
 * This method is very complex to implement.
 * The provider will give a content buffer to you, then your box should render its contents on this buffer.
 * This type is only supported for 3rd party livebox such as OSP and WEB.
 * Inhouse(EFL) livebox is not able to use this buffer type for the box content.
